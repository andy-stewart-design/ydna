A react hook for levaraging the Request Animation Frame API to create looping animations, complete with the ability to control playback.

```ts title="useAnimationFrame.ts"
import { useRef, useLayoutEffect } from "react";
// The hook accepts three paramters: a callback function that specifies the animation,
// a boolean that dictates if the animation should autoplay, and an optional object
// for any additional dependencies that should control the animation
export default function useAnimationFrame(
  callback: () => void,
  shouldAnimate: boolean = true,
  deps = {}
) => {
  // creating a stable reference so that we can request and cancle the animation frame
  const frame = useRef<number>(0);
  // the looping animation—fires the callback parameter at ~60fps
  const animate = () => {
    callback();
    frame.current = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  };
  // create a side effect that will fire **before** the browser is painted
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // controls whether the animation should
    if (shouldAnimate) {
      frame.current = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
    // cancle animation frame when the component is unmounted/re-rendered
    return () => {
      frame.current && cancelAnimationFrame(frame.current);
    };
  }, [shouldAnimate, { ...deps }]);
};
```

## In Use

This hooks requires a react `RefObject` and initiates a resize observer on the provided `HTMLEelement` when its component is mounted, and returns an updated width and height for that element whenever the observer is fired. The ResizeObserver API is widely supported (in 94.13% of browsers at the time of writing), so to keep the code lean I am not including a polyfill.

Additionally, the hook also accepts an optional callback function that, if provided, fires anytime the ResizeObserver detects a change to its target’s size.

I use this hook most often when working with HTML canvas, which allows me to dynamically and performantly resize the canvas whenever its container is resized.
