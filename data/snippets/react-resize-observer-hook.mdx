title: "Resize Observer Hook"
summary: "Performantly track the dimensions of an element in React"
framework: "React"

A simple react hook for instantiating an observer to detect when an element is resized and reading its current height and width.

```ts title="useResizeObserver.ts"
import { useEffect, useRef, useState, RefObject } from "react";
// type definitions
export interface ContentRect {
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

export default function useResizeObserver(
  target: RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  callback?: Function | null
) {
  // create a persistent store of the current dimensions of the target
  const [contentRect, setContentRect] = useState<ContentRect>({
    width: 0,
    height: 0,
  });
  // create a stable reference for the observer so we can disconnect it later
  const observer = useRef<ResizeObserver | null>(null);
  // run a side effect once when the component is mounted
  useEffect(() => {
    if (target.current) {
      // set up the resize observer
      observer.current = new ResizeObserver((entries) => {
        // when the target changes size, commit its updated deminsions to state
        const { width, height } = entries[0].contentRect;
        setContentRect({ width, height });
        // if a callback function has been provided, run the function
        if (callback) callback();
      });
      // instruct the observer to watch the target element
      observer.current.observe(target.current);
    }
    // remove the observer when the component unmounts (for performance)
    return () => {
      if (observer.current) observer.current.disconnect();
    };
  }, []);
  // pass the target’s updated dimensions back to the component calling the hook
  return contentRect;
}
```

## In Use

This hooks requires a react `RefObject` and initiates a resize observer on the provided `HTMLEelement` when its component is mounted, and returns an updated width and height for that element whenever the observer is fired. The ResizeObserver API is widely supported (in 94.13% of browsers at the time of writing), so to keep the code lean I am not including a polyfill.

Additionally, the hook also accepts an optional callback function that, if provided, fires anytime the ResizeObserver detects a change to its target’s size.

I use this hook most often when working with HTML canvas, which allows me to dynamically and performantly resize the canvas whenever its container is resized.

```tsx title="ObserveElement.tsx"
import useResizeObserver from "lib/useResizeObserver";
import { useRef } from "react";

export default function ObserveElement() {
  const container = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const { width, height } = useResizeObserver(container);
  return (
    <div ref={container}>
      {width} x {height}
    </div>
  );
}
```

<ReactResizeObserver />

## Caveats + To-dos

- The `ResizeObserver` API is designed to accept multiple targets. As such, it’s demonstrably more performant to instantiate a single observer with multiple targets rather than using a separate `ResizeObserver` per element. Currently, the hook only accepts a single target, as that is almost exclusively how I use it. But to make it more generalizable, it would be nice to refactor it so that it can accept multiple targets.
- At the time of writing, I’m still relatively new to React, so I’m not 100% confident that the we need to useState in this instance. It’s possible that a local variable would be sufficient. I’ll update this post once I’ve developed a more definitive perspective.
